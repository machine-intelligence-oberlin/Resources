### [howmanypeoplearearound](https://github.com/schollz/howmanypeoplearearound)
  _"Calculates the number of people in the vicinity using the approximate number of smartphones as a 
  proxy (since ~70% of people have smartphones nowadays). A cellphone is determined to be in proximity 
  to the computer based on sniffing WiFi probe requests. Possible uses of howmanypeoplearearound include: 
  monitoring foot traffic in your house with Raspberry Pis, seeing if your roommates are home, etc."_
  
### [Driver-Fatigue-Detection](https://github.com/adityachechani/Driver-Fatigue-Detection)
  _"This application detects blinks and alerts of the driver's drowsiness. It handles variable lighting conditions and 
  works pretty well in day as well as in the dark. It uses histogram equalization and gamma correction to eliminate 
  the effect of lighting."_
  
### [Spiking-Neural-Network](https://github.com/Shikhargupta/Spiking-Neural-Network)
  _"This is the python implementation of hardware efficient spiking neural network. It includes the modified 
  learning and prediction rules which could be realised on hardware and are enegry efficient. Aim is to develop 
  a network which could be used for on-chip learning as well as prediction."_
